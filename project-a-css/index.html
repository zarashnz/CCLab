        <h3 class="red-color"> Scientific Name of the Creature</h3>
        <p>Jeliflora Lumina</p>

        <h3 class="red-color">Discovered by / At </h3>
        <p> Dr. Araz Zanhahs in the year 2028, off the coast of Pangkor Laut</p>
    </div>

    <h3> Family </h3>
    <p id="special-para"> Belongs to Jellyfish-flower hybrid organisms</p>

    <h3 class="green-color">Habitat</h3>
    <p>Resides in the depths of the ocean but longs to be near the surface</p>

    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>Its body resembles an orchid flower, with luminous pink and purple hues. It also has tentacles resembling that
        of a
        jellyfish. The creature's body is made of a semi-transparent jelly material that flows gracefully in the water.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
    <p>When the water is dark, the Jeliflora will retract its petals inwards, wilting like a flower closing, reducing
        its size and reducing its glow. When the water is bright, the Jeliflora will bloom and “dance” in the water
        showing off its luminosity and petals.</p>

    <h3>What do we know so far about the creature?</h3>
    <p>The Jeliflora is a beautiful creature, and is open and expressive during daytime. However, it also has a shy and
        anxious side, often retreating into a defensive posture when dark. Despite its jellyfish-like traits, it is not
        known to sting and poses no threat to humans.
    </p>

    <h3>How do we interact with this creature?</h3>
    <p>If you touch the creature, it will squish like a jelly dessert. </p>
