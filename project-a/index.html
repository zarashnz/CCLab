                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>It resides in a unique region of the ocean where sunlight reaches even the deepest depths of the
                    ocean.
                    It takes a liking to the stream of ocean bubbles, oftentimes floating amongst them.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>It takes on the form of a hibiscus flower and a sea nettle jellyfish.
                    When it is in a social mood, it shifts between pink and purple luminous hues.
                    Its petals are made out of semi-transparent jelly material that flow gracefully in the water.
                    However, when it starts to feel a little reserved, it shrinks and freezes in place, its color fading
                    away slowly.

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Jeliflora?</span>
                Researchers have observed that the Jeliflora likes to wear its heart on its petals and have quickly been
                able to categorize its personality.
                It is a beautiful creature, and is open and expressive during daytime.
                However, it also has a shy and anxious side, often retreating into a wilted state when night approaches.
                Despite its jellyfish-like traits, it is not known to sting and poses no threat to humans.

                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> The Jeliflora is open to
                human interaction,
                it enjoys socializing with all types of people and showing-off its beauty and majestic movements to
                humankind.
                Be mindful that when the sun goes down, the Jeliflora may not be keen to be around visitors, please give
                it its necessary rest and space.
