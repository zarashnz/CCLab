                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
                one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing
                them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as
                well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil
                record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your
                creature.)
